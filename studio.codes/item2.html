        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:rgb(39, 69, 48);font-weight:bold;font-family: verdana;"> 1 What CTO iMacs are and where they are made</span></h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Here’s a riddle to test somebody’s knowledge of Apple. Where is Apple’s only wholly-owned manufacturing facility in the world? Cupertino,
            <br> you venture? Shenzhen, perhaps? No, it’s Cork, Ireland. That’s the Irish city, population 125,622, where Apple employs over 5,500 people, many working in the factory.
            <br>This is the place where Apple staff assemble the iMacs which are CTO (that’s configure-to-order), models for sale in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

            There are other manufacturing facilities but these are owned by other companies.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:rgb(39, 69, 48);font-weight:bold;font-family: verdana;">2 The boxes come with bits of iMac in them</h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">You may be familiar with the distinctively shaped brown cardboard box in which Apple iMacs are shipped. These come from China. 
                    <br>But because when you're transporting by cargo container, you pay for size not weight, Apple takes advantage of this. Inside the brown box is the one with the picture of the iMac on, informally called the pretty box.
                    <br> And inside that is the iMac enclosure (that is the back of the machine), the power supply, the fan and the two speakers. It's a clever way to maximize the efficiency of what comes in the initial shipment.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:rgb(39, 69, 48);font-weight:bold;font-family: verdana;">3 Detail is important</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Inside the iMac is a rubber gasket, a strip of rubber in an L shape which runs up and along on the right hand side of the machine. It's to prevent electro-magnetic interference.
                            <br> It's only needed on the right-hand side. But this is Apple, so a similar gasket is placed on the other side of the rear of the enclosure, making a pleasingly symmetrical effect when you look at it.

                            And the level of attention to detail that this represents is magnified when you realize that this is something almost nobody will ever see, as it's inside a sealed unit! Well, if a job's worth doing…</p>
                            <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:rgb(39, 69, 48);font-weight:bold;font-family: verdana;">4 They're quick to build, and they're not</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: center;">Watching the guys in Cork assemble an iMac is almost hypnotic. They are skilled, and very fast. In fact, the iMac is assembled in not much more than 35 minutes.
                                    <br> But that's not the end of the story. Every single iMac they build then goes through quality control and testing. Each is power-cycled multiple times, and run for between nine and 22 hours. If everything works perfectly, it's on its way.

                                    Of the assembly line products, a much smaller percentage go through even more thorough testing and if a fault is found in any of these, say a key fails on a keyboard, then the next 44 units are checked for this fault to avoid a repeating error.</p>
                                    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:rgb(39, 69, 48);font-weight:bold;font-family: verdana;">5 It all moves at quite the pace</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align: center;">There's a section of the factory with walls and glass panels to keep you out. That's because on the other side are robots who dash around at quite a pace.
                                            <br> iMacs are clamped into place on square wooden trays. The screens are switched on and the iMacs are powered from underneath. But as one robot truck passes its load to the next, the power is transferred to metallic strips underneath the tray.
                                            <br> The clamps holding the computers in place have to be solid because the trucks zoom back and forth faster than you would believe. It's quite a sight.
