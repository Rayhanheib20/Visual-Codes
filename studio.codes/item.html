    <p style="text-align: center;">The first Apple computer, the Apple I, was sold in 1976 for $666.66. The first 50 units were sold to a local computer store.
        <br> In total, 200 units of Apple I were made.This model was essentially a circuit board. It had no case, keyboard, sound, or graphics.
        <br> Computers at the time were sold as kits, but Apple I was a completely assembled board.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">2. Apple II</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Apple II was released in 1977, and it ran at 1 MHz and an 8-bit bus using an 8-bit microprocessor. It came with 4KB
     <br>of RAM and could be hooked to a cassette tape recorder and a TV. It had numerous upgrades from the previous model,
     <br> including a case, an integrated keyboard, and expansion slots for floppy disks, among other components. </p>
     <h3 style="text-align: center;" >3. Apple II Plus</h3>
     <p style="text-align: center;">In 1979, Apple II Plus was released as the second model of the Apple II series.
         <br>It was similar to the original Apple II but had additional features such as better graphics and disk booting capability.
        <br> It came with 48 kb of RAM that was expandable to 64 KB using a language card.  When it was released it was retailing at $1200. 

        It wasn’t the success of the Apple II, though, and it was discontinued in 1982.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> 4. Macintosh</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The first Macintosh was unveiled on January 24, 1984, becoming the first commercially successful PC to feature GUI (graphical user interface),
            <br> a mouse, and an operating system (System 1, the earliest type of Mac OS).
            <br> The Macintosh had 64KB of RAM and could support a 256X256 pixel black and white bitmap display. It used a Motorola 6809E processor.
            <br> It also featured other software programs such as MacWrite (Word processor) and Mac Paint (graphics program). </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">5. Macintosh Classic</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Macintosh Classic was introduced on October 15, 1990, becoming the first Apple computer to sell for under $1,000.
            <br> It was introduced following the success of the earlier models. 
            The specifications of the Macintosh Classic were similar to the earlier versions, including 4MB memory, 512×342 pixel resolution, and a 9-inch CRT display. 
            <br>The company did not make updates using newer technology because it wanted it to remain compatible with the previous models and maintain the price at the lower end. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">6. Macintosh Classic II</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Macintosh Classic II was introduced in 1991 and was quite similar to its predecessor, the Macintosh Classic. However, 
            <br>it was significantly powerful and featured a 16 MHz 68030 processor, 9-inch monochrome display, and 2MB of RAM. It did not have an expansion slot,
            <br> and it was the last Mac to use a 9-inch black and white screen.  </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">7. Macintosh Color Classic</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Macintosh Color Classic, also known as Performa 250, came on the market in February 1993.
            <br> It was the first color compact Macintosh PC with a small integrated 10-inch display screen with 512×384 pixels resolution. 

            The computer featured a 16 MHz 68030 Motorola processor and 4 MB of RAM. Overall, it was designed more like Apple II, with an expansion card to be fitted into the PDS slot.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">8. Macintosh Performa 5200CD</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Macintosh Performa is a family of Apple computers that were released in the 1990s.

            <br> It also featured a 790 MB or 1.0 GB hard drive, a TV tuner, and video input. The model had a 32-bit processor and a 64-bit data path. The production of this model was discontinued in February 1996.</p>
